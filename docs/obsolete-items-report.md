# Obsolete Items Report

This report identifies obsolete or unused elements in the codebase that can be safely removed or refactored.

## Obsolete Directories

1. **xyz/** - This directory appears to be a planning or experimental directory that is now obsolete.
   - Contains a README.md with website improvement plan
   - Contains an empty assets/css/design-system directory
   - All functionality has been properly implemented in the main codebase
   - Recommendation: Remove this directory as it's redundant and may cause confusion

## Possible References to Check

Please review these files for any references to obsolete paths or components:

1. Check TailwindCSS configuration for any references to the xyz directory
2. Check any import statements in JavaScript/CSS files that might reference components in obsolete locations
3. Verify that all links in Markdown files point to valid locations

## Next Steps

1. Remove the xyz directory
   ```bash
   git rm -rf xyz
   ```

2. Check for and fix any broken references in the codebase
3. Commit the changes
   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore: remove obsolete files and directories"
   ```

4. Update documentation to ensure it refers to the correct file locations

## Benefits of Cleanup

- Reduces confusion for developers working on the codebase
- Decreases repository size
- Ensures a clean and maintainable structure
- Prevents accidentally using outdated code or approaches
